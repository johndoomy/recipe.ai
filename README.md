# Recipe.AI

Generate any recipe by integrating chatGPT

## Description

I wanted to learn how to implement a full stack application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express js, React, Node.js) tech stack. I also wanted to familiarize myself with the chatGPT API and also learn React-Redux. After cooking a recipe that I had asked chatGPT to create, it was very delicious if you are wondering, I decided to revisit my idea of a recipe app where one could create and store recipes. This web application allows the user to type in a desired recipe and make a call to chatGPT to create and send back a detailed recipe for any kind of food.

## Tech

- MERN Tech stack
- Mongoose
- React-Redux
- React-Router
- Material UI
- chatGPT API
- JWT for user verification
- Bcrypt for password encryption

## Roadmap

- implement various user account settings
- add ability to scale recipe quantities as desired
